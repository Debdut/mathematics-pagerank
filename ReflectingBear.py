# # Reflecting Bear
# ## Background
# Panda Bear is confused. He is trying to work out how things should look when reflected in a mirror, but is getting the wrong results.
# In Bear's coordinates, the mirror lies along the first axis.
# But, as is the way with bears, his coordinate system is not orthonormal: so what he thinks is the direction perpendicular to the mirror isn't actually the direction the mirror reflects in.
# Help Bear write a code that will do his matrix calculations properly! 
# 
# ## Instructions
# In this assignment you will write a Python function that will produce a transformation matrix for reflecting vectors in an arbitrarily angled mirror.
# 
# Building on the last assingment, where you wrote a code to construct an orthonormal basis that spans a set of input vectors, here you will take a matrix which takes simple form in that basis, and transform it into our starting basis.
# Recall the from the last video,
# 
# \\( T = E T_E E^{-1} \\)
# 
# You will write a function that will construct this matrix.
# This assessment is not conceptually complicated, but will build and test your ability to express mathematical ideas in code.
# As such, your final code submission will be relatively short, but you will receive less structure on how to write it.
# 
# ### Matrices in Python
# For this exercise, we shall make use of the @ operator again.
# Recall from the last exercise, we used this operator to take the dot product of vectors.
# In general the operator will combine vectors and/or matrices in the expected linear algebra way,
# i.e. it will be either the vector dot product, matrix multiplication, or matrix operation on a vector, depending on it's input.
# For example to calculate the following expressions,
# 
# \\( a = \mathbf{s}\cdot\mathbf{t} \\)
# 
# \\( \mathbf{s} = A\mathbf{t} \\)
# 
# \\( M = A B \\),
# 
# One would use the code,
# ```python
# a = s @ t
# s = A @ t
# M = A @ B
# ```
# (This is in contrast to the \\(*\\) operator, which performs element-wise multiplication, or multiplication by a scalar.)
# 
# You may need to use some of the following functions:
# ```python
# inv(A)
# transpose(A)
# gsBasis(A)
# ```
# These, respectively, take the inverse of a matrix, give the transpose of a matrix, and produce a matrix of orthonormal column vectors given a general matrix of column vectors - i.e. perform the Gram-Schmidt process.
# This exercise will require you to combine some of these functions.
# 
# ### How to submit
# Edit the code in the cells below to complete the assignment.
# Once you are finished and happy with it, press the *Submit Assignment* button at the top of this notebook.
# 
# Please don't change any of the function names, as these will be checked by the grading script.

# GRADED FUNCTION
# You should edit this cell.

# In this function, you will return the transformation matrix T,
# having built it out of an orthonormal basis set E that you create from Bear's Basis
# and a transformation matrix in the mirror's coordinates TE.
def build_reflection_matrix(bearBasis) : # The parameter bearBasis is a 2×2 matrix that is passed to the function.
    # Use the gsBasis function on bearBasis to get the mirror's orthonormal basis.
    E = gsBasis(bearBasis)
    # Write a matrix in component form that performs the mirror's reflection in the mirror's basis.
    # Recall, the mirror operates by negating the last component of a vector.
    # Replace a,b,c,d with appropriate values
    TE = np.array([[1, 0],
                   [0, -1]])
    # Combine the matrices E and TE to produce your transformation matrix.
    T = E @ TE @ inv(E)
    # Finally, we return the result. There is no need to change this line.

# ## Test your code before submission
# To test the code you've written above, run the cell (select the cell above, then press the play button [ ▶| ] or press shift-enter).
# You can then use the code below to test out your function.
# You don't need to submit this cell; you can edit and run it as much as you like.
# 
# The code below will show a picture of Panda Bear.
# If you have correctly implemented the function above, you will also see Bear's reflection in his mirror.
# The orange axes are Bear's basis, and the pink axes are the mirror's orthonormal basis.
